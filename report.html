                <h2>Problem Description</h2>
                <p>
                    My website is about Internet of Things devices and platforms. My website features five webpages. The
                    home page features a brief description of the Internet of Things (IOT), a video that may answer any
                    remaining questions about the basic principle of the IOT. The home page also presents a picture and
                    short descriptor of each of the IOT platforms and/or devices that will be discussed on this website. I
                    have created a webpage for each of the following devices and systems:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>BBC Micro:bit</li>
                    <li>Arduino</li>
                    <li>Raspberry Pi</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The fifth webpage will offer tutorials for beginner about how they can get started with each of these
                    IOT devices/platforms. The website also features a contact form.

                </p>
                <p>

                    A typical user of my website would be someone who is interested in working in the IT industry. Through
                    my research, it has become apparent to me that a major concern of employers is the lack of IT skills in
                    emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things. Becoming acquainted with IOT systems will help
                    students succeed in their future careers. I believe it is extremely important for students to educate
                    themselves on this subject so they can tackle the demands of the IT industry. The more relevant their
                    learning, the more likely they are to secure better, higher-paying jobs.

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>
                    My biggest inspiration in terms of the layout and styling of the website is microbit.org. I found their
                    use of white containers on a light grey background very appealing. I thought it looked sleek and modern.
                    I also looked at techradar.com and took inspiration from their navigation bar. I decided to put my
                    navigation bar at the top of my website, under the header image. As part of my research, I went through
                    raspberrypi.com. I found that I did not like the layout of their site. Despite the modern feel to it, I
                    thought it looked a bit messy. Following this, I decided to keep the design of my website simplistic yet
                    visually appealing. I also decided to include an image carousel, inspired by mccarthywebsites.com.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">

                <h2>Technology Selection and Site Architecture</h2>
                <p>
                    This website was built using HTML5 and CSS3. After applying what I had learned from my research, the
                    basic design of my website features a top navigation bar and white content containers silhouetted by a
                    light grey background. The colour theme is blues and greys. I wanted the website to look refined and
                    professional. I included collapsible content with animation and an image carousel to reinforce the
                    contemporary look. I used media queries to account for responsive design. This way, the website is
                    suitable for use on phones, tablets and PCs. In relation to cross browser compatibility, I regularly
                    validated the HTML and CSS. I kept in mind that some browsers don't support the latest CSS and
                    JavaScript features. I maintained a clear layout so the website would be functional in all browsers. I
                    tested the website in Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">

                <h2>JavaScript Functionality</h2>
                <p>
                    My website features collapsible content. Once the button is clicked on, the hidden content will slide
                    down. After button has been pressed, a minus symbol is displayed to show that the collapsible content is
                    open. It displays a plus symbol when the collapsible content is closed. The collapsible content serves
                    to answer quick-fire questions the user may have about the subject at hand.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The website also features an automatic image carousel. The carousel automatically switches to the next
                    image every two seconds. The images fade in to create a smooth transition. The image carousel displays
                    three different models of Raspberry Pi to give the user an idea of what they look like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last JavaScript feature I included was video swap buttons. When the buttons are clicked on, the
                    appropriate video plays. There is a next button which brings the user to the subsequent video.
                </p>

                <h3>Evaluation of Low Fidelity Protoypes</h3>
                <p>
                    I believe these prototypes follow the consistency and standards for web development. The
                    navigation bar indicates to me that the site is easy to navigate, and that the user has
                    complete control and freedom. The layout is reminiscent of other tech-related websites
                    with a simple and minimalistic aesthetic.

                <h2>Development Plan</h2>
                <h3>How the site will be created:</h3>
                <p>
                    The site will be created in the following order. The first step will be researching content and taking
                    inspiration from other sites. The next step will be drawing up wireframes of each webpage. Next, I will
                    gather the images and videos for my website. Following this, I will choose the colour scheme, and start
                    to do some basic HTML, validating as I go along. I will work on the HTML until I am happy with the
                    structure. I will start on CSS and refer back to my wireframes. I will make the website responsive, and
                    fit to be viewed on phones, tablets and PCs. I will then plan the JavaScript features that I will
                    implement once the HTML and CSS is complete. I will first implement the collapsible content. I will then
                    implement the image carousel. Finally, I will create the video swap buttons that will feature on the 
                    tutorials webpage.

                </p>

                <h3>How the CSS rules were created to work on the five pages:</h3>
                <p>
                    I created a separate CSS file and referenced this file in all of my HTML files. I thought that this
                    would be beneficial because I wouldn't have to start from scratch for each webpage. I knew from very
                    early on that I wanted to use white containers on a grey background. I created two classes to enable me
                    to do this. The first class was “maincolumn” which would keep the basic structure of the containers. The
                    other class was “card” which I used to style the white container. I also styled a header section, a
                    navigation bar and a footer section, which are featured on all webpages.
                </p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>Testing Plan</h2>
                <p>
                    I used validatorw3.org for HTML validation. I would input my markup onto validatorw3.org and work
                    through the errors that would appear. I used this website regularly to prevent big errors from
                    occurring. This website is responsive. I used media queries to achieve this.

                <h2>Site Evaluation</h2>
                <p>
                    I feel that my website keeps the user well-informed. The user can tell which page they are on from the
                    title in the tab on the browser, the page title, and the bolded text on the nav bar. I have made an
                    effort to make the language on my website colloquial and familiar to users. I believe that the
                    information on my website is presented in a clear and logical manner. The user has complete control and
                    freedom over where they can go on the website. The nav bar allows the user to move freely from page to
                    page. The appropriate error messages are displayed when using the contact form so the user is kept informed 
                    of what they have done wrong.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I am confident that my website follows the general standards of web development. I have taken
                    inspiration for my website from other technology-related websites. The format is particularly
                    reminiscent of that of microbit.org. I am of the opinion that my website maintains a minimalistic and
                    sleek aesthetic throughout. Mention contact forms error messages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I completed usability testing for my website. I enlisted the help of my sister and a friend. I observed
                    as they completed a list of predetermined tasks. The user was required to acquire a definition for
                    Micro:bit, Arduino and Raspberry Pi. They were also required to fill out the contact form and report on
                    how smoothly it went. I also requested that they get to Arduino's twitter account through the website.
                    The users reported back that the website was easy to use and the feedback was postitive.

                <h2>Weekly Logs</h2>
                <h3>Week 1</h3>
                <p>
                    I have decided to make a website about Internet of Things devices. I will create a homepage in which I will be covering the basic principles of the Internet of Things. I will create separate webpages where I will discuss each of the following devices: BBC Micro:bit, Raspberry Pi and Arduino. I will be giving examples of applications of each of these devices. I will also discuss their origin and creators. 

                </p>

                <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <p>
                    I am creating a website about Internet of Things devices including Raspberry Pi, BBC Micro;bits, and Arduino. This week I researched the origin of Micro:bits. I found that it is an open-source hardware ARM-based embedded system. I found that it was released in 2016 as part of the BBC’s Make it Digital campaign. I also drew up a wire-frame sketch of each of the webpages. I decided on the layout of the website and I looked at other technology-themed websites for inspiration.
                </p>

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <p>
                    This week I set up the folders for my website including an ‘Assets’ folder with three sub-folders for CSS, images, and JavaScript. I started to do some basic HTML and to get an idea of the layout of my webpage. I also researched images I could use when talking about the Internet of Things.
                </p>

                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <p>
                    This week I started the CSS of my website. I decided on a colour scheme. I designed the header for my website. I added some images onto the main webpage which is about the Internet of Things. I chose one of the JavaScript features that I will implement next week. I have decided to include a drop-down menu. 
                </p>

                <h3>Week 5</h3>
                <p>
                    This week I implemented the JavaScript dropdown menu. I finalised my research on Raspberry Pi and Arduino. I put all of the information on my website. I planned to do an image carousel. I also gathered more images. I started on my contact form.
