                    Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino
                    boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and
                    turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can
                    tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do
                    so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on
                    Processing.

                    Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex
                    scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and
                    professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions have added up to an
                    incredible amount of accessible knowledge that can be of great help to novices and experts alike.

                <p>
                    Arduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping, aimed
                    at students without a background in electronics and programming. As soon as it reached a wider
                    community, the Arduino board started changing to adapt to new needs and challenges, differentiating its
                    offer from simple 8-bit boards to products for IoT applications, wearable, 3D printing, and embedded
                    environments. All Arduino boards are completely open-source, empowering users to build them
                    independently and eventually adapt them to their particular needs. The software, too, is open-source,
                    and it is growing through the contributions of users worldwide.

                Arduino boards are relatively inexpensive compared to other microcontroller platforms. The least expensive
                version of the Arduino module can be assembled by hand, and even the pre-assembled Arduino modules cost less
                than ‚Ç¨40.

                The Arduino Software (IDE) runs on Windows, Macintosh OSX, and Linux operating systems. Most microcontroller
                systems are limited to Windows.

                The Arduino Software (IDE) is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users to take
                advantage of as well. For teachers, it's conveniently based on the Processing programming environment, so
                students learning to program in that environment will be familiar with how the Arduino IDE works.

                The Arduino software is published as open source tools, available for extension by experienced programmers.
                The language can be expanded through C++ libraries, and people wanting to understand the technical details
                can make the leap from Arduino to the AVR C programming language on which it's based. Similarly, you can add
                AVR-C code directly into your Arduino programs if you want to.

                The plans of the Arduino boards are published under a Creative Commons license, so experienced circuit
                designers can make their own version of the module, extending it and improving it. Even relatively
                inexperienced users can build the breadboard version of the module in order to understand how it works and
                save money.
