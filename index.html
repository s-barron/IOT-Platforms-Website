                    <h2>The Internet of Things</h2>

                    <p>
                        The Internet of Things is a term we often hear thrown around these days, but what actually is it?
                        To put it as simply as possible, the Internet of Things describes a system of interrelated,
                        internet-connected objects that are able to collect and transfer data over a wireless network
                        without human intervention. These objects are embedded with sensors, software, and other
                        technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over
                        the internet.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But why is the Internet of Things important in our modern world? Well Over the past few years, IoT
                        has become one of the most important technologies of the 21st century. Now that we can connect
                        everyday objects — kitchen appliances, cars, thermostats, baby monitors — to the internet via
                        embedded devices, seamless communication is possible between people, processes, and things.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By means of low-cost computing, the cloud, big data, analytics, and mobile technologies, physical
                        things can share and collect data with minimal human intervention. In this hyperconnected world,
                        digital systems can record, monitor, and adjust each interaction between connected things. The
                        physical world meets the digital world — and they cooperate.

                This website will discuss how we can educate ourselves on IOT platforms and devices by looking at the BBC
                Micro:bit, Arduino and Raspberry Pi. See below for a brief description of each of these devices. The IT
                skills gap is growing. Topping employers' list of concerns is a lack of IT skills in emerging technologies,
                such as the Internet of Things. Learning IoT skills now, using advanced industry- standard technology,
                tools, and processes, will help students succeed in their future careers. They'll gain the knowledge they
                need to tackle the demands of the IT industry - and the more relevant their learning, the more likely they
                are to secure better, higher-paying jobs.

                        The BBC micro:bit is a pocket-sized computer that introduces you to how software and hardware work
                        together. It has an LED light display, buttons, sensors and many input/output features that, when
                        programmed, let it interact with you and your world.

                        Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs
                        and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital
                        devices.

                        The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV,
                        and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all
                        ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python.
